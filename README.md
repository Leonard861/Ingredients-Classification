Summary :
This project is an individual project I worked on during my free time. In this project, I used transfer learning from the pretrained MobileNetV2 model for image classification. The model achieved an accuracy of 97% and a validation accuracy of 99%, indicating that the model is really good for image classification.

Duration : November 2024 (1 Week)

Tasks :
•	Collected data from a Kaggle dataset.
•	Preprocessed data, including spliting data, normalizing data, and augmenting data.
•	Fine-tuned and evaluated the model.
•	Tested the model to classify images.

Results :
The model can accurately classify ingredients, achieving an accuracy of 97% and a validation accuracy of 99%. However, the model can only classify images with a single ingredient.

Skills Developed :
•	Python
•	Machine Learning
•	Transfer Learning
•	Computer Vision
•	Image Classification
